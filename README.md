# React Portfolio with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

Hello! This is a portfolio mostly with React. Becuase Create React App doesn't include page routing, I used React Router to include multiple pages in my portfolio. I also have a Python script to parse the data.json file and add new content. This portfolio is deployed through GitHub Pages and I have a custom domain which I configured with my domain provider. You can find more information about React Router and GitHub Pages below!

React Router: https://reactrouter.com/en/main
GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com/

This is not an official guide on making the portfolio, since a lot of the information are missing. I still need to update and add on a lot of steps, which I'll do in the future.

## Set Up

To create the React app, 
`yarn create react-app my-app`
Will create the app named `my-app`

## Editing

To see live changes on a localhost, run `yarn start`

## Deploy

To deploy changes to the deployed version, run `npm run deploy`
